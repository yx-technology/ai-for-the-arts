# AI for the Arts and Humanities Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio work for the AI for the Arts and Humanities (A) course. It includes my coding exercises, notes, reflections, and creative design tasks completed across the semester. The focus of the course is on understanding code, using AI-assisted tools, and critically engaging with the social and cultural implications of AI.

**Content**  
- Part 1 – Setting Up the Environment:
GitHub basics, Codespaces, Markdown, Python “Hello World,” and first coding exercises.
- Part 2 – Understanding Code:
Python concepts (variables, functions, loops, lists, dictionaries, conditionals, etc.) explored with Microsoft Copilot; algorithms → pseudocode → code; basic text, image, and audio processing; introduction to scikit-learn datasets and pandas.
- Part 3 – Machine Learning:
Running the machine-learning workflow notebook, exploring key ML concepts, and reflecting on ethical, social, and cultural implications.
- Part 4 – Creative LLM Design:
A design proposal for a creative application using a large language model, including critical reflection on inclusion, engagement, and responsible AI.
