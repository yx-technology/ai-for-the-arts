    "###### Group discussion: The first verion was great, as a basic idea of how the task manager could work. However, the second version was even better as the user can input the task and change the task and its deadlines without touching the backend (code) of the task manager. One point about the second version was the reliance on the accuracy of the information entered. Like using the term \"done\" to stop the process makes it highly dependent on the accuracy of the user input, which could lead to a situation where the user has to re-inpupt tasks simply because they misspelled \"done\" and the system logged it as a task instead of as a typo and did not stop the programme.
